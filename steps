create ec2 jenkins-server
ubuntu 2022.
t2.xlarge
no key-pair instead using SSM
-default VPC, SG should have ports open to Jenkins port 8080 and Sonarqube server. 
-storage gp2 - 30 GB
-IAM instance profile - admin access AA-Access lot of things like ECR , 
S3 etc.
-disabled SSh access, instead of connecting to machine using PuTTy, AWS UI 
is used using SSM. 
coz, .pem file cannot be provided to everyone. 

-User-data script - instead of login to jenkins-server , whenevr the instance
is created the script will run and install jenkins ,docker,terraform, 
AWS CLI,using container for Sonarqube instead of directly installing it.
Also install Trivy for image-scanning. 

why this is preferred instead of installing each package manually?
- we have disabled SSH access so that nobody can access instance and needed 
is put in user-data. 

- check the installation process - htop ( current commands running) 
 
- jenkins user created - other than admin 
install plugins - 
> to run terraform scripts through Jenkins , install plugins manually. 
1.AWS credentials - store credentials only in AWS site.
2. pipeline- works with AWS API
3. terraform
4. Stage view ( to visualize the pipeline build)
- store few credentials in jenkins credentials. 
- id created will be used in jenkins pipeline to fetch the credentials. 
- for access key and secret access key, install IAM user, granted admin access to this IAM user. (max 2 is limit)
- configure terraform . tools > system

we are using a single jenkins node architecture , where we are using jenkins
as master and also as agent.
